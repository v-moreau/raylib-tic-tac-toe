# A tic-tac-toe using Raylib

This is my first C program using the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library. It is an implementation of the tic-tac-toe game.

The makefile has been written for M1 macs, and compiling using `make` also requires the file `libraylib.a` which can be obtained from the [Raylib repo](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).
